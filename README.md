This is a Descentralized Application for making secure, eSigned transactions with Ether

# Objective

The goal is to have a secure system based on the blockchain to buy stuff from retailers to wholesalers by specifiying the amount of Ether 
they want to exchange. It's 100% secure because the invoice data is stored in the Ethereum Ropsten Network and in a IPFS invoice.

The users are able to make payments and electronically sign the invoice. It's a 1-1 interaction that identifies users by their wallet address.
